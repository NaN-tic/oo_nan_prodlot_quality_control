    Module developed for Trod y Avia, S.L.

    This module supply an infrastructure to define Quality Test that the
    Production Lots must pass in some situations. It adds a workflow to
    Production Lot.
    Adds a new simple model for Quality Test to define Triggers (a mark to
    specify when a test must be passed) a model related to product with
    one2many field which define which tests must to pass the lots of the
    product specifying the Test Template and the Trigger. In the Company there
    are a similar field and one2many to define the general tests (when a
    product is created take the default values from these values).
    In the Production Lot there are a similar model and one2many field but
    relates the Lot with a trigger and Test.

    IMPORTANT: This module without anything else do not define any Test to pass
    It will be defined in other dependant modules.
